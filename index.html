        <li><strong>The Walking Dead</strong></li> is my favorite game that is a mix of both horror and story telling! Its a dramatic and heartfelt game based on a zombie apocalypse where your decisions can either <em>kill or save</em> a life
      </p>

      <p> <li><strong>The Last Of Us </strong></li> is another zombie apocalypse but a bit different. This game is also a dramatic and heartfelt story, with more violence and horror. This game is a <em>Third person shooting game</em> where you can see your character and have the free will of moving the character around wherever. There is a second game following the story of Ellie and what happens at the end of the first game
